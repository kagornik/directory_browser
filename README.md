## Directory Browser

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Technologies

- React<br />
- Redux<br />
- Jest<br />
- TypeScript<br />

I chose these technologies because I feel most comfortable in them and I wanted to present myself in the best possible way.
